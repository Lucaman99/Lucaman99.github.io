# Hello everyone, and welcome to my blog!

This is where I will write about assorted topics that I really don't want to include on my more "academic" Quora blog.

This isn't to say that this blog will be non-academic
(pretty much everything I do is academic in some way). Some of the main content that will be included on this blog is observations that I make about math/physics/coding/the world in general, my experience at the ISSYP physics program during the summer, and product updates for my forest-fire simulation startup.

Anyways, I hope you (the reader) find this blog somewhat entertaining and/or informative!
