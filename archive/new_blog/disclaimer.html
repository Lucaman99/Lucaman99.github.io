                  <p>
                 I have decided that I am going to begin posting my thoughts on more political topics on this blog. My dissatisfaction with the current state of society has reached a metaphotrical "boiling point".
                 Staying silent doesn't seem like an option anymore. I don't expect people to actually read these posts, but I need a place to discuss my thoughts, and I think that some people may find them interesting.
                 I am by no means an authority on any political topic. I am likely incredibly naive and incredibly wrong/misguided in a lot of my thoughts and lines of reasoning. A lot of my opinions will likely change over the next few years, and I am very open  to changing my mind. However, I want to write down my ideas now,
                 and then decide at some point in the future whether I was misguided or not. The reason I am writing this disclaimer is to tell you (the reader) my goal in this writing. My aim is to incite academic and logical thought,
                 not lower this forum to the emotional rants and the "noise" that we see on social media, and oftetimes, in the news. There is a very high probability that anyone reading this won't agree with what I am saying, and I want to say: this is a good thing!
                 Interesting advances in thought occur when people debate and exchange ideas. If you (the reader) do want to discuss certain ideas outlined in my posts (or, other ideas that <b>aren't</b> outlined in my posts), I am always welcome to chatting, so please don't hesitate
                 to reach out. While I don't agree with all political viewpoints, I maintain huge <b<>respect</b> for people who have these alternate viewpoints and have thought about their convictions carefully. I do not respect
                 people who let emotions cloud their judgement, people that are eternally unbudging in their opinions. These are often the people that simply like to incite chaos, these are te
                 people that feel the need to shout and flail about to get their point across. I personally believe that this blog isn't the right forum for these kinds of people to engage with, so I thought it best
                 to write a warning before you (the reader) begin reading. I am not a scholar. My thoughts are not even close to being as deep and nuanced as those of distinguished intellectuals. Yet, I still feel as though
                 it is important for one to express their thoughts and feelings in some capacity. Ultimately, I truly believe that we will accomplish so
                 much more as a society, as a collective people that moves forward through collective discussion and action, if we adhere to the decorum set forth in academic proceedings (rather than social media), and I hope that in some
                 tiny way, this blog is able to contribute to this type of discourse.
                 <br><br>
                 Thanks you for reading, and I hope that you enjoy the blog!
