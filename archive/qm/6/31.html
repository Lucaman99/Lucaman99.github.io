<h2>Griffiths Quantum Mechanics 2nd Edition: Problem 6.31</h2>

In this problem, we will be examining the Van der Waals Interaction between two atoms. While these atoms are electrically neutral, if we introudce a small perturbation, on the distance between the electrons were to change slightly, we can see an attractive potential arise between the atoms. First, we must consider our perturbation. Let $x_1$ be the distance between the nucleus and the electrons (in this simple model, we will just be considering the electrons to all be the same distance from the nucleus, and the charge in the nucleus to equal to the charge of the electrons, which will be set to the elementary charge). We also let $x_2$ be the distance between the nucleus and the electrons. We can construct our perturbation by considering the attractive or repulsive potentials between each of the charged particles:

$$H' \ = \ \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\Big[ \frac{e^2}{r} \ - \ \frac{e^2}{r \ - \ x_1} \ - \ \frac{e^2}{r \ + \ x_2} \ + \ \frac{e^2}{r \ - \ x_1 \ + \ x_2}\Big]$$
