                    This is a pretty interesting problem! Essentially, we are asked to find the normal modes of oscillation, which are super useful when solving physical systems that involve some sort of "coupling" between parameters within the equations in motion. In this particular case, we are faced with masses attached to identical springs in a circular fashion.
