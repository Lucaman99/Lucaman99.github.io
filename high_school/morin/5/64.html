    <h2>Morin Introduction to Classical Mechanics: Chapter 5 Problem 64</h2>
    <br>
    <b>Part A</b>
	We are first tasked with demonstrating that in order for the gravitational force 
	of Earth to increase as we descend through the crust towards the core, it must be true 
	that $\rho_c \ < \ (2/3)\rho_{avg}$, where $\rho_c$ is the density of the Earth at surface-level, 
       near the upper layer of the crust, and $\rho_{avg}$ is the average density of the Earth.
       <br><br>
       In order for it to be true that the gravitational force increases upon descent, it must 
       be true that the derivative of the force with respect to "distance travelled downwards" 
       is positive (a negative derivative would imply that the force is decreasing at some point).
       We'll keep this fact in mind for later.

       Now, let's try to find out what force actually is. Imagine we have a mass $m$ at distance $R$ 
       away from the center of the Earth. By Gauss' law for gravitation (as was outlined 
       earlier in the chapter), the only contribution to force comes from the region contained inside the 
       sphere with $m$ on the surface:

       $$F \ = \ \frac{GM(R)m}{R^2}$$

       We can find $M(R)$ by integrating across the contributions of each co-centric shell making up the sphere:

       $$M(R) \ = \ \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R} \rho(r) dS \ = \ 4\pi \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R} \rho(r) r^2 dr$$

       This gives us:

       $$F(R) \ = \ \frac{4G \pi m}{R^2} \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R} \rho(r) r^2 dr$$

       We then take the derivative to get:

       $$\frac{dF}{dR} \ = \ 4 G \pi m \frac{d}{dR} \frac{1}{R^2} \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R} \rho(r) r^2 dr \ = \ 
       4 G \pi m \Big[ -\frac{2}{R^3} \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R} \rho(r) r^2 dr \ + \ \frac{1}{R^2} \Big( \frac{\rho(R)}{R^2} \Big) \Big] \ = \ 
        4 G \pi m \Big[\rho(R) \ - \ \frac{2}{R^3} \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R} \rho(r) r^2 dr \Big]$$

       Now, let's take a quick detour and consider the value of $\rho_{avg}$. By definition, this is just the total mass 
       of Earth divided by the total volume. This implies that we will have:

       $$\rho_{avg} \ = \ \frac{M_{E}}{V_{E}} \ = \ \frac{4 \pi \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R_E} \rho(r) r^2 dr}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_{E}^{3}}$$

       where $R_E$ is the radius of the Earth. Rearranging this gives us:

       $$\displaystyle\int_{0}^{R_E} \rho(r) r^2 dr \ = \ \frac{\rho_{avg} R_E^3}{3}$$

    <br><br>
    <b>Part B</b>
    <br><br>

    Consider the force being exterted on the mass above the sheet. We'll first consider the vertical force acting on the mass by an infinitesimally 
    thin sheet. Let our mass be  a distance $x$ from the sheet. We will have:

    $$F(d)_{S} \ = \ G m \displaystyle\int \frac{1}{x^2} dm \ = \ 2 \pi G m \rho dx \displaystyle\int x \tan \theta \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{x^2} \cos \theta d\theta \ =  \ 
    2\pi G \rho m \frac{dx}{x} \displaystyle\int \ \sin \theta \cos^2 \theta d\theta \ = \ \frac{2 \pi G \rho m}{3} \frac{dx}{x}$$

    Now, assume the mass of a distance $d$ from the top of the entire sheet. We will have:

    $$F(d) \ = \ \frac{2 \pi G m \rho}{3} \displaystyle\int_{d}^{d \ + \ x} \frac{1}{x} dx \ = \  \frac{2 \pi G m \rho}{3} \Big[ \ln (d \ + \ x) \ - \ \ln d \Big]$$

     Now, the force acting on the mass by the Earth is given by:

    $$F_g(\ell) \ = \ \frac{G M m}{\ell^2} \ = \ \frac{4 \pi G M \rho_{avg} R_E^3}{3 \ell^2}$$

    When   

    <b>Part C</b>
	<br><br>
    Our final task is to find how density should vary with distance under the surface of the Earth, such 
    that the gravitational force remain constant. Well, for this to be true, we must have:

    $$\frac{d F}{dR} \ = \ 0$$

    Using the formula we derived above, we get:

    $$ 4 G \pi m \Big[\rho(R) \ - \ \frac{2}{R^3} \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R} \rho(r) r^2 dr \Big] \ = \ 0 \ \Rightarrow \ 
    \rho(R) \ = \ \frac{2}{R^3} \ \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R} \rho(r) r^2 dr \ \Rightarrow \ \rho(R) R^3 \ = \ 2 \displaystyle\int_{0}^{R} \rho(r) r^2 dr
    \ = \ \frac{2 \pi G m \rho}{3} \ln \Big( \frac{x \ + \ d}{d} \Big)$$

    We can then take the derivative once again to get:

    $$ \frac{d \rho}{d R} R^3 \ + \ 3R^2 \rho(R) \ = \ 2 \rho(R) R^2 \ \Rightarrow \ \frac{d \rho}{dR} \ = \ -\frac{\rho (R)}{R}$$

    This is a simple separable differential equation, so we get:

    $$\displaystyle\int \frac{d\rho}{\rho} \ = \ \displaystyle\int \frac{dr}{R} \ \Rightarrow \ \ln \rho \ = \ C \ - \ \ln R \ \Rightarrow \ \rho \ = \ \frac{A}{R}$$

    If we let $\rho_C$ be the density at the crust, we will have:

    $$\rho(R) \ = \ \frac{\rho_C R_E}{R}$$

    Thus, for force to remain constant, the density must be inversely proportional to the radius from the center of the Earth, approaching infinity near 
    the center of the Earth.
