                <h2>Morin Introduction to Classical Mechanics: Chapter 6 Problem 45</h2>
                <p>
                    <br><br>
		   The goal of this problem is to find the normal modes of oscillation of a fairly simple system comprised of a mass that is free to rotate on a ring. We begin by considering
		   a point mass $m$ that is free to rotate on the rim of a massless wheel, with a mass $M$ located at the center. In order to find the normal modes of small oscillations, we
		   first have to construct the Lagrangian. We must consider the kinetic energy of both masses, as well as the gravitational potential. For the potential, we have:
		   <br><br>
			$$U(\theta) \ = \ mgR(1 \ - \ \cos \theta)$$
		    <br>
		Now we must determine the kinetic energy. We will find the velocity of $m$ in the $x$ and $y$ directions in terms of our coordinate system. Let $X$ be the horizontal distance at
		which $M$ is located. It follows that the $x \ = \ X \ + \ R \sin \theta$ and $y \ = \ R(1 \ - \ \cos \theta)$. Thus, it follows that the total kinetic energy is given by:
		<br><br>
		$$T \ = \ \frac{1}{2} M \dot{X}^2 \ + \ \frac{1}{2} m\dot{x}^2 \ + \ \frac{1}{2} m \dot{y}^2 \ = \ \frac{1}{2} M \dot{X}^2 \ + \ \frac{m}{2} \big[ (\dot{X} \ + \ R \cos \theta
		\dot{\theta})^2 \ + \ R^2 \dot{\theta} \sin^2 \theta \big]$$
		$$\Rightarrow \ T \ = \ \frac{M \ + \ m}{2} \dot{X}^2 \ + \ \frac{1}{2} mR^2 \dot{\theta}^2 \ + \ m R \cos \theta \dot{X} \dot{\theta}$$
		<br>
		This gives us:
		<br><br>
		$$\mathcal{L} \ = \ \frac{M \ + \ m}{2} \dot{X}^2 \ + \ \frac{1}{2} mR^2 \dot{\theta}^2 \ + \ m R \cos \theta \dot{X} \dot{\theta} \ - \ mgR(1 \ - \ \cos \theta)$$
		<br>
		Now, let's attempt to solve the Euler-Lagrange equation for both coordinates. We will start with $X$, which gives us:
		<br><br>
		$$\frac{d}{dt} \ \Big[ (M \ + \ m) \dot{X} \ + \ mR \cos \theta \dot{\theta} \Big] \ = \ (M \ + \ m) \ddot{X} \ + \ mR \big[ \cos \theta \ddot{\theta} \ - \ \sin \theta \dot{\theta} \big] \ = \ 0$$
		$$C \ = \ (M \ + \ m) \dot{X} \ + \ mR \cos \theta \dot{\theta} \ \Rightarrow \ \frac{d C}{dt} \ = \ 0$$
		<br>
		Thus, $C$ is a conserved quantity, which we might find useful later. In fact, this is exactly the total momentum of the system in the horizontal 
		direction, as one can easily check. This makes complete sense, as there are no external forces acting on the system in the horizontal direction (only gravity, in 
		the vertical direction), which would imply that momentum should be conserved horizontally. Now, let's set up the Euler-Lagrange equation for $\theta$:
		<br><br>
		$$mR^2 \ddot{\theta} \ + \ mR \big[ \cos \theta \ddot{X} \ - \ \sin \theta \dot{X} \big] \ = \ - mgR \sin \theta \ - \ mR \sin \theta \dot{X} \dot{\theta}$$
		<br>
		Now, we can make some simplifications, and expand $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ to the first order, as we are interested in small oscillations. In addition, it is clear
		that the equilibrium angle for this system is $\theta \ = \ 0$, which makes things pretty easy:
		<br><br>
		$$ \ddot{\theta} \ = \ - \frac{g}{R} \theta \ - \ \frac{1}{R} \theta \dot{X} \dot{\theta} \ - \ \frac{1}{R} \big[ \ddot{X} \ - \ \theta \dot{X} \big]$$
		$$\ddot{X} \ = \ \frac{mR}{M \ + \ m} \big[ \ddot{\theta} \ - \ \theta \dot{\theta} \big]$$
