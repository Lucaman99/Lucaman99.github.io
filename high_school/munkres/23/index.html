	<b>Problem 11</b>
	
	<div class="theorem">
	Let $p : X \ \rightarrow \ Y$ be a quotient map. If each set $p^{-1}(\{y\})$ is connected, and if $Y$ is 
	connected, then $X$ is connected.
	</div>

	<div class="proof">
		Assume that there exists a separation $A \ \cup \ B \ = \ X$. It would follow that each 
		$p^-1(\{y\})$ would have to be contained completely in either $A$, or $B$ (not both, or else 
		$A \ \cap \ p^{-1}(\{y\})$ and $B \ \cap \ p^-1(\{y\})$ would separate $p^{-1}(\{y\})$). Thus, 
		$A$ and $B$ are saturated open sets. Since a quotient map maps saturated open sets to open sets, 
		it follows that $p(A)$ and $p(B)$ are open set whose union is $p(X) \ = \ Y$ (from the surjectivity of 
		$p$). Assume that $p(A) \ \cap \ p(B) \ \neq \ \emptyset$. It would follow that there exists some $y$ such 
		that $p(a) \ = \ p(b) \ = \ y$, for $a \ \in \ A$ and $b \ \in \ B$. It would follow that $p^{-1}(\{y\})$ would 
		intersect both $A$ and $B$, which can't be the case. Thus, $p(A)$ and $p(B)$ are disjoint, and therefore 
		form a separation of $Y$. This is a contradiction, so $X$ must be connected.
	</div>

	<div class="theorem">
      Let $A \ \subset \ X$. If $C$ is a connected subspace of $X$ that intersects both $X$ and $X \ - \ A$, then $C$
      intersects $\text{Bd} \ A$.
	</div>

  <div class="proof">
      Assume that $C$ does not intersect $\text{Bd} \ A$. This implies that there exists no point of $C$ that is in both
      $\bar{A}$ and $\overline{X \ - \ A}$. Consider some point $x \ \in \ C$. If $x \ \in \ C \ \cap \ A$, it follows that
      there exists at least one neighbourhood of $x$ that does not intersect $X \ - \ A$ (or else $x \ \in \ \overline{X \ - \ A}$).
      Similarly, if $x \ \in \ C \ \cap (X \ - \ A)$,
      it follows that there exists at least one neighbourhood of $x$ that does not intersect $A$ (or else $x \ \in \ \bar{A}$).
      We call such open sets $U_x$ for each $x$.
      For each $x \ \in \ C$, consider the intersection $U_x \ \cap \ C$. Each of these sets are open in $C$. Now, consider:

      $$U_{A} \ = \ \displaystyle\bigcup_{x} \ U_x \ \cap \ C \ \ \ \ \ \ x \ \in \ C \ \cap \ A$$
      $$U_{X \ - \ A} \ = \ \displaystyle\bigcup_{x} \ U_x \ \cap \ C \ \ \ \ \ \ x \ \in \ C \ \cap \ X \ - \ A$$

      Clearly, $U_A$ and $U_{X \ - \ A}$ form a separation of $C$, contradicting the fact that it is connected. Thus, $C$ must
      intersect $\text{Bd} \ A$.
