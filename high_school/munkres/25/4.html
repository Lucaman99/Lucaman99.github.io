	<div class="theorem">
		If $X$ is locally path-connected, then every connected open set in $X$ is path-connected.
	</div>

	<div class="proof">
		Let us choose some point $x$ of an arbitrary connected open set $U$. Take the subset $A$ of 
		$U$ to be the set of all points $a$ such that $x$ and $a$ are path-connected. We realize that $A$ 
		is simply the path-component of $U$ containing $x$. 
	<br><br>
		By Theorem 25.4, for each open set of $X$, each path-component is open 
		in $X$. Thus, $A$ is open in $X$, and thus, open in $U$. By Theorem 25.5, the components and path-components of $X$ are the same. 
		Since the components of a set will be closed, it follows that the path-components of $X$ are also closed. 
		Thus, $A$ is both open and closed in $U$. 
		<br><br>
		Since $U$ is connected, the only subset of $U$ that is both open and closed in $U$ is $U$ itself. Thus, $A \ = \ U$. 
		This implies that each pair of points in $U$ connected by a path, making $U$ path-connected.
