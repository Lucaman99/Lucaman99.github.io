    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a high school student from the Greater Toronto Area with a great interest in mathematics, physics, and quantum computing.
      I love working on projects that leverage the beauty and abstraction within pure mathematics, and physics, as I believe that these diciplines
       are where true artistry and creative thought lie. I also like to use these fields to solve large, important problems in the world. I am always
        looking for new projects that involve my interests, so please feel free to reach out!</p>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <li><b>Forest Fire Modelling</b></li>
      <br>
      <ul>
        For the past several months, along with a friend, I have been working on a mathematical and physical model, a cellular automata simulation, and a data-gathering
            robot that can help to predict how forest fires will spread within a forest. The robot can also detect fires, and send back coordinates of the flame in real time. A link to an article published
            on the Tech Under 20 website about this project can be found <a href="https://techundertwenty.com/building-a-wildfire-sim-robot/">here</a>.
        <br><br>
        I wrote a paper(-ish) on some of our results concerning clustered forest grid configurations!!! Check it out, I would REALLY APPRECIATE any feedback!!!! <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q1auYICbICXWG1NFpQzeKT1_ae1eBO50/view?usp=sharing">Clustered Variations of Cellular-Automata Forest Fire Simulations</a>

      <li><b>Math, Physics and Quantum Computing Writing</b>
        <ul>
          <br>
          <li>I have written a fair deal of content about math and physics on the question-answer website, Quora.
            Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Ceroni">profile</a> and in addition,
          here is a link to my math/physics <a href="https://mathacademy.quora.com/">blog</a> (which is hosted on Quora).</li>
          <br>
          <li>I also create and write solutions to problems on the website Brilliant.org. This past Christmas, I posted the 12 Days of Math-mas,
            which was a recreational mathematics problem set. Here is a link to my <a href="https://brilliant.org/profile/jack-tj20jb/">profile</a>.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In addition to Quora, I write about quantum computing and other cool technology on the website, Medium. My profile can be found
              at this <a href="https://medium.com/@jackceroni">link<a/>.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I'm currently writing a formal solution manual to selected problems in Griffiths Introduction to Quantum Mechanics Textbook! You can check that out at this <a href="https://lucaman99.github.io/qm/">link</a>.
              In addition, I have written up a bunch of solutions to problem in Munkres' Topology textbook, but I haven't typed all of them up yet. Hopefully that will be done soon and the website
              link will be posted here. UPDATE: It has arrived, enjoy! <a href="https://lucaman99.github.io/munkres/">Munkres Topology</a></li>
                <br>
            <li>I've also written a bunch of other assorted notes/problem set solutions, etc. about other topics in physics and math. A complete set of all of the
              content that I have written about technical math/physics topics can be found <a href="https://github.com/Lucaman99/Math-and-Physics/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Other Stuff</b>
        <br>

          <li>Some notes on tensor analysis and fluid dynamics can be found <a href="https://lucaman99.github.io/physics/vutha_meeting">here</a>.</li>
          <br>
          <li>My blog, where I write about math/physics/coding, as well as a bunch of other stuff (This project will be kicked-off starting in summer 2019) can be found <a href="https://lucaman99.github.io/physics/blog">here</a></li>
