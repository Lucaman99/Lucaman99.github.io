* Pre-Meeting Agenda

- We'll spend the first 5-ish minutes on just introducing ourselves.
- We can then spend the next 20-ish minutes discussing Artin/paging through the table of contents, and 
  discussing what stuff seems reasonable to cover
- We'll spend the next 20-ish minutes going through the schedule, and the notes discussing the solution manual/seeing 
  what everyone thinks about all of that stuff.
- We'll spend the final 5 minutes wrapping things up and assinging reading for week 1. I'm thinking that we should assign problems 
  on maybe Monday?
