* Introduction

The goal of this post is to go through the details of Kontsevich's seminal 1997 paper proving that there is a canonical deformation quantization for every Poisson manifold.
This post could end up being very long, but I really want to get this right.

* Some background

The idea of deformation quantization is that the algebra of quantum observables, which is non-commutative, should be obtained as a "deformation" of the commutative algebra of classical observables,
with respect to some Planck-constant parameter $\hbar$, controlling the "quantum-ness" (i.e. we recover the classical algebra when we take $\hbar \to 0$). To be more specific, our non-commutative product
is called a /star product/:

*Definition 2.1.*  Let $A = \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ be the $\mathbb{R}$ -algebra of smooth functions on finite-dimensional smooth manifold $X$. A differential operator $D : A \rightarrow A$ is an algebra homomorphism
such that in local coordinates $(U, x^1, \dots, x^n)$, $D(f)$ can be written as

\begin{equation}
D(f) = \sum_{|J| \leq k} D(f)_{J} \frac{d^{|J|} f}{dx^J}
\end{equation}

where $D(f)_J$ is a smooth function on $U$. Clearly, differential operators form a ring under addition and composition.

*Definition 2.2.*  A star product is an associative, $\mathbb{R}[[\hbar] ]$ -linear (formal
power series in $\hbar$ with real coefficients) on $A[[\hbar] ]$ (in particular, $A[[\hbar] ]$ is an $\mathbb{R}[[\hbar] ]$ -module, in the obvious way) which satisfies for $f, g \in A \subset A[[\hbar] ]$,

\begin{equation}
f \star g = fg + \hbar B_1(f, g) + \hbar^2 B_2(f, g) + \cdots = fg + \sum_{k \geq 1} \hbar^k B_k(f, g)
\end{equation}

where each $B_k : A \otimes A \rightarrow A$ is a bi-differential operator. This product must extend linearly to the entire algebra, namely

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:a}
\left( \sum_{n \geq 0} f_n \hbar^n \right) \star \left( \sum_{m \geq 0} g_m \hbar^m \right) = \sum_{n, m \geq 0} f_n g_m \hbar^{n + m} + \sum_{n, m \geq 0, \ell \geq 1} B_{\ell}(f_n, g_m) \hbar^{n + m + \ell}
\end{equation}

*Proposition 2.1.* The collection of automorphisms of $A[[\hbar] ]$ of the form

\begin{equation}
\sum_{n \geq 0} f_n \hbar^n \mapsto \sum_{n \geq 0} f_n \hbar^{n} + \sum_{n \geq 0, m \geq 1} D_m(f_n) \hbar^{n + m}
\end{equation}

form a group under composition, where each $D_m : A \rightarrow A$ is a differential operator. Moreover, these automorphisms act on the collection of star products, in the sense that if $D(\hbar) = 1 + \sum_{m \geq 1} D_m \hbar^{m}$ is such
an automorphism and $\star$ is a star product, then

\begin{equation}
f(\hbar) \star' g(\hbar) = D(\hbar) (D(\hbar)^{-1}(f(\hbar)) \star D(\hbar)^{-1}(g(\hbar)))
\end{equation}

is also a star product.

/Proof./ Of course, the group operation is just the usual multiplication of formal power series of the form $D(\hbar)$, so

\begin{equation}
D(\hbar) \cdot D'(\hbar) = 1 + D(\hbar) + D'(\hbar) + \sum_{n, m \geq 1} (D_n \circ D_m) \hbar^{m + n}
\end{equation}

where we know that composition of derivations is a derivation. It is easy to see we have the identity and associativity, and closure (sums and compositions of derivations are derivations). To
prove that we have an inverse, we use the fact that a formal power series over a ring has a multiplicative inverse if and only if the zeroth-degree term is invertible in the ring. Of course, $1$ is
invertible, so we can write down the inverse of $D(\hbar)$ using the usual inversion formula for formal power series. We have $D(\hbar)^{-1} = 1 + \sum_{m \geq 1} F_m \hbar^m$ where

\begin{equation}
F_m = - \sum_{k = 1}^{m} D_k \circ F_{m - k}
\end{equation}

for $m \geq 1$. In addition, it is clear that when we expand, $\star'$ is of the form of Eq. \eqref{eq:a}, as we are composing differential and bi-differential operators. Suppose $\star'$ is represented in terms
of bi-differential operators $B_{\ell}'$. If we can show that the $B_{\ell}'$ are associative, then the $\star'$ product will be as well. It is easy to see that this is equivalent to $\star'$ being associative
when acting on \emph{functions}. We can prove this readily:

\begin{align}
h \star' (f \star' g) &= h \star' D(\hbar)(D(\hbar)^{-1}(f) \star D(\hbar)^{-1}(g))
\\ &= D(\hbar)(D(\hbar)^{-1}(h) \star (D(\hbar)^{-1}(f) \star D(\hbar)^{-1}(g)))
\\&= D(\hbar)((D(\hbar)^{-1}(h) \star D(\hbar)^{-1}(f)) \star D(\hbar)^{-1}(g))
\\ &= (h \star' f) \star' g
\end{align}

where we use the associativity of $\star$. $\blacksquare$

We will be interested in $\star$ -products up to "gauge equivalence" (i.e. $\star$ and $\star'$ are equivalent if they are related as above). In fact,
if $S$ denotes the set of all star products, it is easy to show that $D(\hbar) \times \star \mapsto \star'$ is a group action.

** Aside on category theory and Hochschild homology

Now, let us go on a brief aside and review the concept of Hochschild homology, which is a homology theory for algebras. To properly motivate this homology theory,
we will need an aside on the aisde, into some categorical language.

*Definition 2.3.* Let $A$ be an algebra over ring $R$. Let $M$ be an $M$ -module. We let $C_n(A, M) = M \otimes A^{\otimes n}$ where all tensor products are over $R$.
We also define the boundary operators

\begin{align}

\end{align}

* Appendix 1: category theory

I am relegating the introduction of certain categorical language to this section, an appendix.

*Definition A.1.1* (Adjoint). The best, succinct way to think of a functor $G : D \rightarrow C$ adjoint to functor $F : C \rightarrow D$ is that $G$ is the most efficient way to systematically
"solve the problem" posed by $F$. If $F$ is, for example, a forgetful functor which throws away some of the structure of category $C$, is there a method with reconstructs an element of $D$ which imposes the
minimal amount of extra structure possible? If such a method exists, and is functorial, in the sense that it works the same for any object, then it can be described via a functor $G : D \rightarrow C$
which is adjoint to $F$.

Let us now be more precise. We say that functors $F : C \rightarrow D$ and $G : D \rightarrow C$ are adjoint is there exists a "natural bijection" between the morphism sets $\text{Hom}_D(d, F(c))$
and $\text{Hom}_C(G(d), c)$ for $d \in \text{Obj}(D)$ and $c \in \text{Obj}(C)$. By "natural", we mean that for a fixed $c \in \text{Obj}(C)$ or a fixed $d \in \text{Obj}(d)$, the following diagrams commute:

for every arrow $g : d' \rightarrow d$ in $D$ and $f : c \rightarrow c'$ in $C$. Even though this definition is the most common, it is not the most intuitive. A better definition is via universal morphisms. When
we find an object which satisfies a universal property, we are effectively finding the "most efficient" object which satisfies some desired property. An adjoint functor is a technique to define such universal
objects at a global, categorical level, rather than locally. To be more specific,

*Example A.1.1* (Free groups). I went into a lot of detail regarding the construction of free groups in my blog post on groupoid Seifert-Van Kampen theorem. This is probably one of the most accessible examples
of an adjoint functor.

In particular, suppose we have set $S$. For each element $s \in S$, we can define a infinite cyclic group which is labelled by $s$. For convenience, we take elements of this cyclic
group to be denoted by $s^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, and we define $\cdot$ as the operation $s^{n} \cdot s^{m} = s^{n + m}$. We also use $1$ to denote $s^0$. Call this group $G_s$. We showed in the Seifert-Van Kampen
post that there exists an external free product of the groups $G_s$, for all $s \in S$, which we denote $G_S$. We actually had a particular name for $G_S$: the free group on generators $S$. Remember how we defined
the external free product of groups: we said that $G$ was an external free product of $G_{\alpha}$ if there existed monomorphisms $i_{\alpha} : G_{\alpha} \rightarrow G$ such that for any collection of morphisms
$\varphi_{\alpha} : i_{\alpha}(G_{\alpha}) \rightarrow H$, there exists a unique morphism $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ which extends the $\varphi_{\alpha}$. For the particular case that the $G_{\alpha}$ are the
cyclic groups $G_s$. Note that each monomorphisms $i_{s} : G_s \rightarrow G$ can be uniquely represented by a unique element of $G$. Thus, each collections of monomorphisms $\{i_s\}_{s \in S}$ can
be uniquely represented by a /set/ map $i : S \rightarrow G$. Thus, one can rephrase the property which characterizes the free group as follows: $G$ is a free group of generators $S$ if there is a
set map $i : S \rightarrow G$ such that each $\langle i(s) \rangle$ is infinite cyclic, and for any collection of morphisms, $\varphi_s : \langle i(s) \rangle \rightarrow H$, there is a
unique $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$ extending them.

Something we can notice:
for some set map $i : S \rightarrow G$ to satisfy the desired criterion, it must /a priori/ be injective. If we had $i(s) = i(s') \neq 0$, and we chose different homomorphisms $\varphi_s, \varphi_{s'}$ into some group (which
we can always do), then we obviously couldn't find an extension $\varphi$. It follows immediately that any collection of $\{\varphi_s\}$ can be uniquely represented as a set map $f : S \rightarrow H$.
Thus, the property we must satisfy becomes the following: we need an a set map $i : S \rightarrow G$ such that for any set map $f : S \rightarrow H$ (where $H$ is a group), there exists a unique morphism $\varphi : G \rightarrow H$
such that $\varphi \circ i = f$. In addition, we require that all of the subgroups $\langle i(s) \rangle$ are free. As it turns out, we can drop this assumption. Suppose $\langle i(s) \rangle$ were not free, so $i(s)^n = 1$ for
some $s$ and $n \neq 0$. Pick $f : S \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ to send every $s \in S$ to $2$, let $\varphi : G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be the unique morphism where $\varphi \circ i = f$. We then must have $\varphi(i(s)) = f(s) = 2$, but
we also have
\begin{equation}
0 = \varphi(1) = \varphi(i(s)^n) = \varphi(i(s))^n = 2n \neq 0
\end{equation}

which is a contradiction. Thus, $G_S$ is a free group with generators $S$ if there is a set map $i : S \rightarrow G_S$ such that for any group $H$ and set map $f : S \rightarrow H$,
there exists a unique morphism $\varphi : G_S \rightarrow H$ with $\varphi \circ i = f$.

Let us recap what we have done: given some $S \in \text{Obj}(\textbf{Set})$, we have described the property some $G = \text{Free}(S) \in \text{Obj}(\textbf{Grp})$ must satisfy for $\text{Free}(S)$ to be
a "free group with generators $S$", in terms of morphisms in the categories $\textbf{Set}$ and $\textbf{Grp}$. This is a local procedure: we have "defined" $\text{Free}(S)$ via a /particular/ set $S$ in $\textbf{Set}$
and arrow $i$ from $S \in \textbf{Set}$ to $\text{For}(\text{Free}(S)) \in \text{For}(\textbf{Grp})$ (where $\text{For}$ is the forgetful functor which gets rid of group structure). As it turns out,
this strategy works /globally/: we can actually think of $\text{Free}$ as a functor from $\textbf{Set}$ to $\textbf{Grp}$: it is /adjoint/ to $\text{For}$, the forgetful functor. This is the prototypical example
one should always carry.

Let us
