* Introduction

In this blog post, I'm covering two unrelated results in smooth manifold theory which I was recently reading about/don't want to forget, neither of which is really long enough
for their own blog post. So, here we are.

* Densities and measures on manifolds

I want to briefly discuss how one goes about defining Lebesgue measure on smooth manifolds. Given an $n$ -dimensional vector space $V$, we define a density $\mu : V \times \cdots \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
to be a function such that for any linear map $T : V \rightarrow V$,

\begin{equation}
\mu(Tv_1, \dots, Tv_n) = |\det(T)| \mu(v_1, \dots, v_n)
\end{equation}

Obviously, $\mu$ is only non-zero when it is fed a basis for $V$, and its value on any other basis is then determined by the determinant of the transition matrix between
the new basis and the reference basis. We denote the set of all densities on $V$ as $\mathcal{D}(V)$. Given a smooth manifold $M$, we can always consider the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{B}(M)$,
and some Borel measure $\mu : \mathcal{B}(M) \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ (we could also consider signed and complex measures). However, there is no canonical choice of measure in this formulation. Ideally,
we would like to use the fact that a manifold is locally Euclidean to define a ``Lebesgue measure" on $M$.

To this end, 

* Milnor's proof of the collar neighbourhood theorem
