<h2>David Morin Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: Chapter 5 Problem 29</h2>
<p>
   This is the first post to my webstie using LaTeX.css. I'm probably going to use it for all of my posts now (it looks so much cleaner than my previous format, 
   and has built-in functionality that supports writing lemmas, theorems, proofs, etc.)

   Now, let's consider what happens as masses are passing around the infinitesimal bend. We know that in this second scenrio, energy is conserved, which means that
   any change of momentum of masses within the chain must be elastic in nature. Let's think about the the change of momentum as some infinitesimal $dm$ goes around the bend.
