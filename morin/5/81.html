                <h2>Morin Introduction to Classical Mechanics: Chapter 5 Problem 81</h2>
                <p>
                    <br><br>
                    This problem isn't particularly elegant (although the CM frame is slick), but I want to write it out to cement my understanding of the CM frame.
                    We are tasked with proving that in a collision of "billiard balls" (two balls of equal mass colliding elastically, with one ball being initially stationary), the resulting trajectories
                    will be orthogonal to each other.
                    <br>
                    We can begin by setting up our problem: we have one ball moving towards the other at velocity $v_0$. We can calculate the velocity of the CM frame, relative to the lab frame:
                    <br><br>
                    $$u_x \ = \ \frac{P_x}{\sum M} \ = \ \frac{mv}{2m} \ = \ \frac{v}{2}$$
                    $$u_y \ = \ \frac{P_y}{\sum M} \ = \ 0$$
                    <br>
                    We can then calculate the velocities of the masses relative to the CM frame
                    <br><br>
                    $$v_{0x}' \ = \ v_0 \ - \ u_x \ = \ \frac{v}{2}$$
                    $$v_{1x}' \ = \ 0 \ - \ \frac{v}{2} \ = \ -\frac{v}{2}$$
                    <br>
                    Where it is clear that the $y$-direction velocities are still $0$. Now, consider this elastic collision in the CM frame: we have two equal masses
                    travelling towards each other at <b>equal velocities</b>. This is an example of the CM frame exposing nice symmetry in a physical system. Let $f_0'$ and 
                    $f_1'$ be the speeds of the respective balls in the CM frame. Since momentum must sum to $0$ in the CM frame and the balls have equal mass, we have:
                    <br><br>
                    $$f_0' \sin \theta_0 \ = \ - f_1' \sin \theta_1$$
                    $$f_0' \cos \theta_0 \ = \ - f_1' \cos \theta_1$$
                    <br>
                    Where $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ are the angles that the ball trajectories make with the horizontal, in the CM frame. It follows that:
                    <br><br>
                    $$(f_0')^2 \big[ \sin^2 \theta_0 \ + \ \cos^2 \theta_0 \big] \ = \ (f_1')^2 \big[ \sin^2 \theta_1 \ + \ \cos^2 \theta_1 \big] \ \Rightarrow \ |f_0'| \ = \ |f_1'|$$
                    <br>
                    So the speeds are equal, which is obvious due to underlying symmetry in the system. Thus, in order for energy to be conserved, it must be true that each ball has a speed of $\frac{v}{2}$.
                     If we go back to the original equations, this implies that $\theta_0 \ = \ \theta_1$.
                    Now, let's switch back to the rest frame with our newly-found CM velocities:
                    <br><br>
                    $$f_{0y} \ = \ \frac{v}{2} \sin \theta$$
                    $$f_{0x} \ = \ \frac{v}{2} (1 \ - \ \cos \theta)$$
                    <br>
                    $$f_{1y} \ = \ -\frac{v}{2} \sin \theta$$
                    $$f_{1x} \ = \ \frac{v}{2} (1 \ + \ \cos \theta)$$
                    <br>
                    Now, if we treat each of these values as the components of velocity vectors, $\vec{f}_0$ and $\vec{f}_1$, we can take the dot product of the vectors
                    to determine the angle between them:
                    <br><br>
                    $$\vec{f}_0 \ \cdot \ \vec{f}_1 \ = \ \frac{v^2}{4} \Big[ -\sin^2 \theta \ - \ \cos^2 \theta \ + \ 1 \Big] \ = \ 0$$
                    <br>
                    Thus, the vectors are orthogonal and we have completedthe proof.
