    <h2>Morin Introduction to Classical Mechanics: Chapter 5 Problem 94</h2>

    <i>
    	I'm trying to only post 3-4 star problem solutions, as these are usually the ones with more nuanced solutions 
	that are worth typing up (plus I can't solve most of them, so I feel more accomplished if I do manage to get one, 
	which gives me more motivation to write up my solution!). This is a 2 star problem, but nevertheless, the result of this 
	problem is pretty cool, so it feels like a good solution to docoument/share.

	In this problem, we are asked to consider a very light dustpan of wheels, rolling 
	down a hill. Spread along the hill is dust of mass density $\sigma \ \text{kg/m}$, along the 
	slope. The dustpan begins to roll down the hill and collects all of the dust in its path. We are 
	asked to find the acceleration of the dustpan.
	<br><br>
	In this particular instance, the mass of the rolling dustpan is increasing, so we use the following 
	form of Newton's second law:

	$$F_{\text{Net}} \ = \ \frac{d p}{dt} \ = \ ma \ + \ \dot{m} v$$

	It is clear that $m(x) \ = \ \sigma x$, which implies that $\dot{m} \ = \ \sigma v$. One can also see 
	that the net force acting on the dustpan at any given point in time is the gravitational force parallel 
	to the slope, which gives us:

	$$\sigma x g \sin \theta \ = \ \sigma x a \ + \ \sigma v^2 \ \Rightarrow \ a \ = \ g \sin \theta \ = \ v \frac{dv}{dx} \ + \ \frac{v^2}{x}$$

	This appears to be a linear differential equation, as $\frac{d}{dx} v^2 \ = \ 2v \frac{dv}{dx}$. Let the integrating factor be $\mu$. We assert that:

	$$\frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dx} \Big( \mu v^2 \Big) \ = \ \mu v \frac{dv}{dx} \ + \ \frac{\mu v^2}{x} \ \Rightarrow \ \mu v \frac{dv}{dx} \ + \ \frac{v^2}{2} \frac{d \mu}{dx} \ = \ \mu v \frac{dv}{dx} \ + \ \frac{\mu v^2}{x}$$
	$$\Rightarrow \ \frac{d \mu}{dx} \ = \ \frac{2 \mu}{x} \ \Rightarrow \ \mu(x) \ = \ Ax^2$$

	where we solved the differential equation on the second line through separation and integration. We thus have:

	$$\mu v \frac{dv}{dx} \ + \ \frac{\mu v^2}{x} \ = \ \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dx} \Big( \mu v^2 \Big) \ = \ \mu g \sin \theta$$
	$$\Rightarrow \ xv^2 \ = \ g \sin \theta x^2 \ \Rightarrow \ v \ = \ \sqrt{g \sin theta x}$$
