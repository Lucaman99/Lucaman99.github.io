	   <b>Theorem (Kuratowski).</b> <i> Let $g$ be the map from all subsets of a topological space $X$ to itself (we 
		   denote this set by $\mathcal{A}$), defined
		   as $g: A \ \rightarrow \ \bar{A}$, with $A \ \in \ \mathcal{A}$. Similarly, let us define $f$ as 
		   a function that performs the mapping: $f : A \ \rightarrow \ X \ - \ A$. It is possible to generate 
		   no more than $14$ distinct sets by applying these operations successsively on some $A$.</i>

   <div class="proof">
	   It seems very unlikely that I will actually solve this problem, but I'm going to give it a try anyways 
	   (kudos to Kuratowski for figuring this out).  We can begin by playing around with the mappings at see what 
	   arises.
	   <br><br>
	   Firstly, it is clear that $(f \circ f)(A) \ = \ A$. Thus, in our sequence of function compositions, we can't 
	   apply $f$ two times in a row, since we are interested in generating unique sets. Consider the mapping $(g 
	   \circ g)(A) \ = \ g(\bar{A}) \ = \ \bar{A}$, since $\bar{A}$ is a closed set, and the closure of a closed set 
	   is the set itself. Thus, we also cannot apply two $g$ operations in a row. We have to alternate between applications 
	   of $g$ and $f$.
	   <br><br>
	   Consider what happens when we apply an operation of the form $(g \circ f)$ on some set $A$. This will result 
	   in the mapping $A \ \rightarrow \ \overline{X \ - \ A}$. Similarly, the operation $(f \circ g)$ yields the transformation 
	   $A \ \rightarrow \ X \ - \ \overline{A}$. In general, since $\overline{X} \ = \ X$, we know that $X \ - \ \overline{A} \ \subset \ 
	   \overline{X \ - \ A}$.

	   $$A \ \rightarrow \ \overline{A} \ \rightarrow \ X \ - \ \overline{A} \ \rightarrow \ \overline{X \ - \ \overline{A}} \ \rightarrow \ X \ - \ \overline{X \ - \ \overline{A}}$$
	   $$A \ \rightarrow \ X \ - \ A \ \rightarrow \ \overline{X \ - \ A} \ \rightarrow \ X \ - \ \overline{X \ - \ A} \ \rightarrow \ \overline{X \ - \ \overline{X \ - \ A}}$$
