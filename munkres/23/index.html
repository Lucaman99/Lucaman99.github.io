	<b>Problem 11</b>
	
	<div class="theorem">
	Let $p : X \ \rightarrow \ Y$ be a quotient map. If each set $p^{-1}(\{y\})$ is connected, and if $Y$ is 
	connected, then $X$ is connected.
	</div>

	<div class="proof">
		Assume that there exists a separation $A \ \cup \ B \ = \ X$. It would follow that each 
		$p^-1(\{y\})$ would have to be contained completely in either $A$, or $B$ (not both, or else 
		$A \ \cap \ p^{-1}(\{y\})$ and $B \ \cap \ p^-1(\{y\})$ would separate $p^{-1}(\{y\})$). Thus, 
		$A$ and $B$ are saturated open sets. Since a quotient map maps saturated open sets to open sets, 
		it follows that $p(A)$ and $p(B)$ are open set whose union is $p(X) \ = \ Y$ (from the surjectivity of 
		$p$). Assume that $p(A) \ \cap \ p(B) \ \neq \ \emptyset$. It would follow that there exists some $y$ such 
		that $p(a) \ = \ p(b) \ = \ y$, for $a \ \in \ A$ and $b \ \in \ B$. It would follow that $p^{-1}(\{y\})$ would 
		intersect both $A$ and $B$, which can't be the case. Thus, $p(A)$ and $p(B)$ are disjoint, and therefore 
		form a separation of $Y$. This is a contradiction, so $X$ must be connected.
