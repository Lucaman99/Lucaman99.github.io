	<br>
	<p>

	<b>Part A</b>

	<div class="lemma">
		Let $X$ be an ordered set; let $a \ < \ b \ < \ c$ be points of $X$. $[a, \ c)$ has order type if and only if 
	     	both $[a, \ b)$ and $[b, \ c)$ have order type of $[0, \ 1)$.
	</div>

	<div class="proof">
		First assume that $[a, \ b)$ and $[b, \ c)$ have order type $[0, \ 1)$. This implies that there exist bijective, order-preserving 
		maps $f_1 : [a, \ b) \ \rightarrow \ [0, \ 1)$ and $f_2 : [b, \ c) \ \rightarrow \ [0, \ 1)$. Let us define the maps $g_1 : [0, \ 1) \ 
		\rightarrow \ [0, \ \frac{1}{2})$ with $g_1(x) \ = \ x/2$ and $g_2 : [0, \ 1) \ \rightarrow \ [\frac{1}{2}, \ 1)$ with $g_2(x) \ = \ 1 \ + 
		\ x/2$. Clearly, both of these maps are also order-preserving and bijective. This implies that:

		$$(g_1 \ \circ \ f_1) : [a, \ b) \ \rightarrow \ [0, \ 1/2) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (g_2 \ \circ \ f_2) : [b, \ c) \ \rightarrow \ [1/2, \ 1)$$

		are also order-preserving and bijective. We define the function $h : [a, \ c) \ \rightarrow \ [0, \ 1)$, with $h(x) \ = \ (g_1 \ \circ \ f_1)(x)$ if 
		$x \ \in \ [a, \ b)$ and $h(x) \ = \ (g_2 \ \circ \ f_2)(x)$ if $x \ \in \ [b, \ c)$. Clearly, this map is bijective. In addition it is easy to see 
		that if we choose any two points $x, \ y \ \in \ [a, \ b)$ with $x \ < \ y$, then $h$ preserves the order. If both $x$ and $y$ are in $[a, \ b)$, or 
	     	both are in $[b, \ c)$, then the preservation of order follows from the fact that $(g_1 \ \circ \ f_1)$ and $(g_2 \ \circ \ f_2)$ preserve order. 
	     	If $x \ \in \ [a, \ b)$ and $y \ \in \ [b, \ c)$, then $h(x) \ < \ h(y)$, an arbitrary element of $[0, \ 1/2)$ will be less than any element of $[1/2, \ 1)$. 
	     	Thus, $h$ is bijective and preserves order, so $[a, \ c)$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$.
		<br><br>
		Conversely, assume that $[a, \ c)$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$. Let $f$ be the order-preserving, bijective function from $[a, \ c)$ to $[0, \ 1)$. Define the 
		bijective functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ to be $f$, but with the domain and range restricted:

		$$f_1 : [a, \ b) \ \rightarrow \ [0, \ f(b))$$
		$$f_2 : [b, \ c) \ \rightarrow \ [f(b), \ 1)$$

		Now, define the following functions:

		$$g_1 : [0, \ f(b)) \ \rightarrow \ [0, \ 1) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ g_1(x) \ = \ \frac{x}{f(b)}$$
		$$g_2 : [f(b), \ 1) \ \rightarrow \ [0, \ 1) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ g_2(x) \ = \ \frac{x \ - \ f(b)}{1 \ - \ f(b)}$$

		It is easy to check that these functions are bijective. It is also quite easy to see that if $x \ < \ y$, then $g_1(x) \ < \ g_1(y)$ and 
	     	$g_2(x) \ < \ g_2(y)$. Thus, the two functions $(g_1 \ \circ \ f_1)$ and $(g_2 \ \circ \ f_2)$ are bijective and order-preserving. This implies 
	     	that $[a, \ b)$ and $[b, \ c)$ have order type $[0, \ 1)$.

  <b>Part B</b>

	<div class="lemma">
		Let $X$ be an ordered set. Let $x_0 \ < \ x_1 \ < \ ...$ be an increasing sequence of points of $X$. Suppose that $b \ = \ \sup \{x_i\}$. 
	     $[x_0, \ b)$ has order type of $[0, \ 1)$ if and only if each interval $[x_i, \ x_{i+1})$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$.
	</div>
	<div class="proof">
		Let us assume that $[x_0, \ b)$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$. The previous lemma implies that $[x_0, \ x_{i+1})$ and $[x_{i+1}, \ b)$ have order type 
		$[0, \ 1)$. We can again use the previous lemma to say that $[x_0, \ x_i)$ and $[x_i, \ x_{i+1})$ have order type $[0, \ 1)$.
		<br><br>
		Conversely, assume that every $[x_i, \ x_{i+1})$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$. This means that for each $i$, there exists some order-preserving bijection $f_i$ that 
		maps the interval to $[0, \ 1)$. For each interval, let us define the functions:

		$$g_i(x) \ = \ \frac{i}{i \ + \ 1} (1 \ - \ f_i(x)) \ + \ \frac{i \ + \ 1}{i \ + \ 2} f_i(x)$$

		We let $g$ denote the peicewise function defined for all such $i$. we assert that $g(x)$ is an order-preserving bijection from $[x_0, \ b)$ to $[0, \ 1)$. 
		Clearly, each $g_i(x)$ is bijective, so $g$ will be a bijection. The union of all the images of the sets is $[0, \ 1)$. In addition, let us pick some point 
		$x \ \in \ [x_0, \ b)$. It follows that $x \ \in \ [x_k, \ x_{k+1})$ for some $k$, or else $x$ would be a lower upper bound on the set $\{x_i\}$ than $b$. Thus, 
		$g(x) \ = \ g_k(x)$ for some $k$. It follows that the image of each point in the domain is well-defined.

	<b>Part C</b>

	<div class="lemma">
	Let $a_0$ be the smallest element of $S_{\Omega}$. For each element $a$ of $S_{\Omega}$ (different from $a_0$), the interval $[a_0 \ \times \ 0, \ a \ \times \ 0)$ of $S_{\Omega} \ \times \ [0, \ 1)$ 
	has order type $[0, \ 1)$.
	</div>

  <div class="proof">
      As is suggested by Munkres, we will proceed by transfinite induction. Let $J$ be the set of all $\alpha$ such that $[a_0 \times 0, \ \alpha \times 0)$ has the order type $[0, \ 1)$.
      We will assume that for some $a \in S_{\Omega}$, that $S_a \subset J$, and prove that $a \in J$, which will imply that $J = S_{\Omega} - \{a_0\}$.
      <br><br>

      Given some $a$, we know, by definition of $S_{\Omega}$, that $S_a$ will be counbtable. In the case that $S_a$ is finite, it will have a maximal element, so $a$ will have an
      immediate predecessor, $b$. We then know that $[a_0 \times 0, \ b \times 0)$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$. We also note that the interval $[b \times 0, \ a \times 0) = b \times [0, \ 1)$
      will clearly have order type $[0, \ 1)$. Thus, from Part A, we conclude that $[a_0 \times 0, \ a \times 0)$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$, so $a \in J$.
      <br><br>

      In the case that $S_a$ is countably infinite, with $a$ as the least upper bound of this set. We define a sequence of elements of $S_a$ as follows: let $x_0 = a_0$, then
      let:
      $$x_i = \min \{S_a - \{x_0, \ ..., \ x_{i - 1}\} \}$$

      (we know that such a minimal element will exist as $S_{\Omega}$ is well-ordered). Since $S_a$ is countable, this
      will yield a strictly increasing, countable sequence of the elements of $S_a$. Since each $x_i \in S_a$, it follows that:

      $$[x_i \times 0, \ x_{i + 1} \times 0) = x_i \times [0, \ 1)$$

      So each $[x_i \times 0, \ x_{i + 1} \times 0)$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$. Thus, by Part B, $[a_0 \times 0, \ a \times 0)$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$,
      as $a = \sup\{x_i\}$.
      <br><br>

      We have shown in both cases that $[a_0 \times 0, \ a \times 0)$ has order type $[0, \ 1)$, so our proof by transfinite induction is complete.

	<b>Part D</b>

	<div class="lemma">
		The space $L$ is path-connected.
	</div>

	<div class="proof">
		  Let us choose two points $a \ \times \ c$ and $d \ \times \ d$ of $S_{\Omega} \ \times \ [0, \ 1)$. We consider the continuous map

      $$f_1 : [0, \ 1/3) \ \rightarrow \ [a \times c, \ a \times 1) = a \times [c, \ 1)$$

      Clearly, such a map exists (it will be of the same form as the maps in the previous sections). Now, let $R_a$ be the set of all $s \in S_{\Omega}$ such that
      $a < s$. Since the set is well-ordered, it follows that such a set has a minimum, $r$. We define the continuous map:

      $$f_2 : [1/3, \ 2/3) \ \rightarrow \ [r \times 0, \ b \times 0)$$.
