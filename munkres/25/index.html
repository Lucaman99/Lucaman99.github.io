                    <div class="theorem">
                        Assume thaat $\mathbb{R}^2$ is path-connected. If $A$ is countable, then $\mathbb{R}^2 - A$ is also path-connected.
                    </div>

                    <div class="proof">

                        We attempt to form a path from $(x_1, \ y_1)$ to $(x_2, \ y_2)$ by finding straight lines through both points that intersect, and then
                        using the pasting lemma to "join" these maps together. More specifically, if.

                    </div>

                    <div class="theorem">
                        Let $X$ denote the set of all rational points of the interval $[0, \ 1] \times 0$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $T$ denote the set of all line-segments
                        joining the point $p = 0 \times 1$ to points of $X$. Show that $T$ is path-connected, but locally connected only at $p$.
                    </div>

                    <div class="proof">
                        Consider the points $x \times 0$ and $y \times 0$ of $T$. Each of these points will lie on some line segement
                        connecting them to the point $p = 0 \times 1$. Thus, we define the maps $f_1 : [0, \ 1/2] \ \rightarrow \ T$ and $f_2 : [1/2, \ 1] \ \rightarrow \ T$
                        such that:

                        $$f_1(t) = ( (1 - 2t)x, \ 2t) \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ f_2(t) = ( (2t - 1)y, \ 2 - 2t)$$

                        Clearly both maps are continuous. Therefore, we can use the pasting lemma to conclude that the function $f$ defined as $f(x) = f_1(x)$ for $x \in [0, \ 1/2]$
                        and $f(x) = f_2(x)$ for $x \in [1/2, \ 1]$ is a continuous map from $[0, \ 1]$ to $T$ such that $f(0) = x \times 0$ and $f(1) = y \times 0$. It follows that
                        $T$ is path-connected.
                        <br><br>

                        Now, we prove local connectedness only occurs at points $p$.
