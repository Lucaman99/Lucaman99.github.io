                        In a first-countable $T_1$ space, every one-point set is a $G_\delta$ set.
                    </div>

                    <div class="proof">

                        We know that there is a countable basis $\{B_1, \ B_2, \ ...\}$ around $x$. Consider the intersection of all such elements.
                        We know that given distinct points $x$ and $y$, there exist neighbourhoods around these points that don't contain eacxh other. Thus,
                        there is some $B_k$ that does not contain $y$. It follows that:

                        $$B = \displaystyle\bigcap_{k} B_k$$

                        does not contain $y$. Thus, it must be the one-point set $\{x\}$. It follows that $\{x\}$ is a $G_\delta$ set.

                    <div class="lemma">
                        Let $X$ have a countable basis. Let $A$ be an uncountable subset of $X$. Uncountably many points of $A$ are limit points of $A$.
                    </div>

                    <div class="proof">
                        Assume that $A$ is an uncountable set with countably many limit points. By definition, there then must be an uncountable number of points in $A$ that
                        are not limit points of $A$. Once again, by definition, any of these points, $a$, must be contained in an open set $U_a$ that intersects $A$ only at itself.
                        <br><br>

                        By definition, for each non-limit point $a$, we must then have $a \in B_k \subset U_a$, where $B_k$ is an element of the countable basis. This is a clear contradiction, as
                        there are uncountably many $a$, and each $U_a$ must be disjoint from all other $U_a$. Thus, $A$ must have an uncountable number of limit points.

                    <br>

                    <div class="lemma">
                        Every compact metrizable space has a countable basis.
                    </div>

                    <div class="proof">

                        For each $x \in X$, we define $B_{1/n}(x)$ to be the $1/n$-ball around $x$ for some natural $n$. We let $A_n$ be the covering made by all such
                        balls. Since $X$ is compact, $A_n$ will have a finite subcovering. We then define:

                        $$A = \displaystyle\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$$

                        Clearly, given an open neighbourhood $U$ (in the metric topology) of some point $x$, we can choose some $B_\epsilon(x)$ such that
                        $x \in B_{\epsilon}(x) \subset U$. We choose $n$ such that $1/n < \epsilon/2$. We know that there must exist some $B_{1/n}(y)$ in $A$
                        that contains $x$. Clearly, we will have $|x - y| < 1/n$ and for $z \in B_{1/n}(y)$ we will have $|z - y| < 1/n$. Thus, by the triangle inequality:

                        $$|x - z| \leq |x - y| + |z - y| < \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n} < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon$$

                        Thus, $x \in B_{1/n}(y) \subset B_{\epsilon}(x) \subset U$. We therefore have a collection $A$ of open sets such that for each $x$ we have $x \in B \subset U$ for
                        each neighbourhood $U$ of $X$, and where $B$ is an element of $A$.
                        Thus, $A$ forms a countable basis of $X$.

                    <div class="lemma">
                        Every metrizable space $X$ with a countable dense subset has a countable basis.
                    </div>

                    <div class="proof">

                        Let $S$ be the countable dense subset of $X$. For each $s_n \in S$, we let $B(s_n)$ be the set of all $1/n$-balls around
                        $s_n$. Clearly, the union $B$ of all $B(s_n)$ will be countable. We assert that this is a basis for the space.
                        <br><br>

                        Given some $x$, and some neighbourhood $U$ around $x$, we know that there exists some $\epsilon$ ball $B_\epsilon(x)$ around $x$. We then
                        consider the $1/2n$ ball $B_{1/2n}(x)$ ball around $x$, where we choose $n$ such that $1/n < \epsilon$.
                        <br><br>

                        By definition of the dense subset, we must have $\bar{S} = X$. Thus,
                        for each $x \in X$, every open neighbourhood of $x$ intersects $S$. It follows that there is some $s_k$ in $B_{1/2n}(x)$. We
                        then consider the $1/2n$ ball around $s_k$, $B_{1/2n}(s_k)$. Since $|x - s_k| < 1/2n$, we know that $x \in B_{1/2n}(s_k)$.
                        <br><br>

                        Clearly, given some $z$ in the $B_{1/2n}(s_k)$ ball, we will have:

                        $$|z - x| \leq |z - s_k| + |s_k - x| < \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{2n} = \frac{1}{n}$$

                        So $x \in B_{1/2n}(s_k) \subset B_{1/n}(x) \subset B_{\epsilon}(x) \subset U$. Thus, each $x$ is contained in an element of $B$, which is itself
                        contained in $U$. It follows that $B$ is a basis.

                    <div class="proof">
                        This follows directly from Lemma 3: we simply replace finite subcover with a countable subcover.

                    <div class="lemma">
                        If $X$ has a countable dense subset, then every collection of disjoint open sets in $X$ is countable.
                    </div>

                    <div class="proof">

                        Suppose that there existed an uncountable collection of disjoint open sets in $X$. For each of these sets that are non-empty,
                        they must intersect the countable dense subset at different points, as they are all disjoint. This would imply that the dense subset is
                        uncountable: a contradiction.

                    <div class="lemma">
                        Give $\mathbb{R}^{I}$ the uniform metric with $I = [0, \ 1]$. Let $C(I, \ \mathbb{R})$ be the subspace consisting of continuous functions.
                        Show that $C(I, \ \mathbb{R})$ has a countable dense subset, and therefore a countable basis.
                    </div>

                    <div class="proof">

                        We consider the set $F$ of continuous functions whose graphs consist of finitely many line segments with rational endpoints.
                        \newline

                        Consider the set $F_n$ of continuous function in $C(I, \ \mathbb{R})$ that consist of $n$ line-segments with rational endpoints.
                        Clearly, such a graph will have $n + 1$ endpoints, which will be a rational pair of the form $(r_1, \ r_2)$. It follows that
                        each graph can be specified by the list of endpoints:

                        $$( (a_1, \ b_1), \ ..., \ (a_{n + 1}, \ b_{n + 1}))$$

                        Since the set of rational number is countable, it follows that the set of all lists of $2n + 2$ rational numbers (the above list)
                        is also countable.
                        <br><br>

                        We then note that:

                        $$F = \displaystyle\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} F_n$$

                        is a countable union of countable sets, so is itself countable.
                        <br><br>

                        Now, we will demonstrate that this countable set is dense in $C(I, \ \mathbb{R})$. Consider some $f \in C(I, \ \mathbb{R})$. Consider some
                        open set neighbourhood $U$ of $f$. It follows that definition of the topology that we can choose some $\epsilon$-ball $B$ such that:

                        $$f \in B \subset U$$

                        By definition: $B = \{g \ | \ \sup \{ \bar{d}(f(x), \ g(x)) \ | \ x \in [0, \ 1] \} < \epsilon \}$.
                        <br><br>

                        For each $x \in [0, \ 1]$, we choose an neighbourhood $U_r$ around $r$ such that $f(U_x) \subset B_{\epsilon}(f(x))$, where
                        $B_\epsilon$ is the $\epsilon$-ball around $f(x)$. Since $[0, \ 1]$ is compact, we choose a finite subcover of the collection of all $U_x$.

                        $$\{U_{x_1}, \ ..., \ U_{x_n}\}$$

                        Clearly, there will be rational number in each $U_{x_k}$, which we call $r_k$. We then consider the set of all such rationals $\{r_1, \ ..., \ r_n\}$.
                        We relabel this finite set so that it is an ordered list of the form $(t_1, \ ..., \ t_n)$.
