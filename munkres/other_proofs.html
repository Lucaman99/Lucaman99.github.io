<h2>Other Random Proofs From Munkres!</h2>
My notebook is full of random proofs to certain propositions in Munkres book that he doesn't really prove himself while he is expalining stuff. While these proofs are not explicit answers
to posed questions at the end of questions, they may be somewhat helpful for people going through the book (and I can compile all the information I want to remember into one place!). This
page will be continuously updated with new "assorted proofs". Hopefully they will be in order (-ish) chronologically by section in the textbook.
