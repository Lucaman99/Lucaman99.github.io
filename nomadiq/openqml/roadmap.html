      <h3>Phase I</h3>
      <p>Over the course of the next 4 months, our plans are to continue expanding the OpenQML gallery. We hope to introduce Notebooks on the following topics
          to the gallery:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
              <li>Proof-of-Concept Protein Folding With QAOA</li>
              <li>Basic Quantum Cellular Automata</li>
              <li>Many-Body Quantum Simulations with Different Ansatzes</li>
              <li>Quantum Hamiltonian Based Models</li>
              <li>Foundational Quantum Machine Learning (i.e. Baqprop, Quantum Natural Gradient Descent, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          In addition to this, we are in the process of making modifications to our pre-existing Notebooks, in order to make them even more comprehensive and accessible. Finally, we are also hoping to
          scale the project by accepting contributions from the quantum open-source community, to make our gallery even more diverse by drawing upon the unique skills of many different individuals. We also
          hop to "translate" our new Notebooks and our existing Notebooks to a variety of the different quantum programming languages (Cirq, Qiskit, Pennylane, etc.).
      </p>
      <!--
      <h3>Phase II</h3>
      After we have completed Notebooks on the outlined topics above, we wish to dedicate the next 2 months to taking the code that has been written for the simulations in the tutorials, and modify
      it to create a small Python library, where users can utilize recent NISQ and QML algorithms at a very high level (for instance, one can simply call an instance of a Quantum Graph Neural Network in
      a few lines of code) in a variety of different languages. This kind of work is being done to a certain extent in other libraries, however, we hope to focus on making methods that work for a variety of
      quantum computational libraries, and focus on recent algorithms that are less likely to have pre-exisiting built-in functions associated with them. The reason for this high-level approach is to allow
      researchers and enthusiasts outside of the quantum research community to experiment with recent algorithms, and attempt to apply quantum methods to some of their problems.
