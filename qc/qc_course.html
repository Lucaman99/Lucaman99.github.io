<h1>Quantum Computation For Near-Term Applications</h1>
<h4>A Course in Quantum Computing/Quantum Mechanics and Their Applications to Problems in Science and Indsutry</h4>
<p style="margin-right:40%;">The goal of this course is to provide a solid foundation for students who want to understand not only the emerging field of quantum computation, but how they can leverage quantum
  technology to solve important problems, even in light of poor qubit coherence and the primitive nature of current quantum-error correction implementations in current quantum hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-right:40%;">Students who wish to take this course will follow the material at their own pace. This will include series of lecture notes, slideshows, ome video lectures, and Python Notebooks, where students will have
  the opportunity to work through comprehensive quantum algorithm/programming challenges and assignments to test their understanding. This course material can also be taken by professors at universities, and
  modified/used to teach their own course in quantum computation.</p>

<p style="margin-right:40%;">Students will complete quantum programming projects using the IBM <b>Qiskit</b> quantum computational simulation library for Python. Students should be familiar with Python prior
  to taking the course, and should be comfortable to a reasonable extent with linear algebra and quantum mechanics, as these topics will only be reviewed breifly at the beginning of the course.</p>

The estimated time-frame for this course is 10 weeks, with a preliminary outline shown below:
<br><br>
<b>Part 1: Theory</b>
