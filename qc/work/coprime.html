<h2>Coprime States - Notes</h2>
<p>
    <h4>Defining Coprime States</h4>
   We define a coprime state as a two-qudit state $|\psi_k\rangle$, such that:
  <br><br> 
   $$|\psi_k\rangle \ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \displaystyle\sum_{n \ = \ k}^{D} \displaystyle\sum_{m \ = \ k}^{D} G(n, m) |n \ m\rangle$$ 
   <br>
   Where we define $G(m, n) \ = \ 1$ if $\gcd(m, n) = 1$ and $0$ otherwise. In addition, we let $k \in \{1, 2\}$, since we will concern oursevles with coprime states
   where we consider $1$ and any other positive integer to be coprime, and states where we don't consider this to be the case. We can go on to consider the density
   matrix defined by the coprime state, which will be given as $\rho_k$:
   <br><br>
    $$\rho_k \ = \ |\psi_k\rangle \langle \psi_k | \ = \ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{a, b} \displaystyle\sum_{c, d} |a \ b\rangle \langle c \ d|$$
   <br>
   Where $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $\gcd(c, d) = 1$. From the density matrix, we can determine more proerties about this quantum state. First, let us consider what happens
   when we take the partial trace over the second subsystem of our state (as we will eventually need this to calculate the entropy of entanglement). We have:
   <br><br>
    $$\rho^{A}_{k} \ = \ \displaystyle\sum_{i} \langle i_B | \rho_k |i_B \rangle \ = \ 
    \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{i} \displaystyle\sum_{a, b} \displaystyle\sum_{c, d} \big[\langle i | b \rangle \langle c | i \rangle \big] |a\rangle \langle d |
     \ = \ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{a, b} \displaystyle\sum_{c, d} \delta_{bc} |a\rangle \langle d |$$
   <br>
   Where $\delta_{bc}$ is the Kronecker delta for $b$ and $c$. Thus, we are effectively summing over the outer product of all basis states that <b>share at least one 
       common positive integer that is coprime to both $a$ and $b$</b>, with different coefficients on each term.
       <br><br>
       We can reduce this further by noting that the coefficient on each term of the sum will simply be the number of positive integers between $k$ and $D$ such that 
       the integer is both coprime with $a$ and $d$ We will call this coefficient $\sigma(a, d)$, and we can write the density matrix as:
        <br><br>
        $$\rho^{A}_{k} \ = \ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{a, d} \sigma(a, d) |a\rangle \langle d|$$ 
       <br>
       This seems to be somewhat related to the definition of the Euler totient function, $\phi(n)$, which is defined to 
       be the number of integers below $n$ that are also coprime to $n$. For instance, in the case of $a = d = D$, we have $\sigma(a, d) = \phi(D)$. We can also look at special 
       cases, for different values of $a$ and $b$. For instance, if both $a$ and $b$ are prime, then they will be coprime with every positive integer between $D$ and $k$, except 
       the number itself, thus we will have $\sigma(a, b) \ = \ D - k$.
       <br><br>
       <h4>A Modified Totient Function</h4>
       Another worthwhile question to consider is what the diagonal elements on this matrix are. If we consider the entries where $a = d$, then we know that the 
       associated entry in the density matrix will be of the form $\sigma(a, a)$, or more clearly, the number of positive integers that are coprime to $a$ from 
       $k$ to $D$. Clearly, we will be considering values of $a$ from $k$ to $D$. Again, we can draw parallels between this and the definition of the Euler totient function. 
       We will denote this function by $\phi_{D}(n)$. Let's begin by considering the properties of $\phi_D$ when it takes a a power of a prime as 
       an argument:
       <br>
       <div class="lemma">For some power of a prime, $p^{\alpha}$, it is true that $\phi_{D}(p^{\alpha}) \ = \ D \ - \ \left 
         \lfloor{\frac{D}{p}} \right \rfloor \ - \ 1$</div>
       <div class="proof">
        For some given $2 \leq x \leq D$, it is true that $\gcd(x, p^{\alpha}) \neq 1$ if and only if $x$ and $p^{\alpha}$ share a common prime factor. The only prime 
        factor of $p^{\alpha}$ is $p$, this is follows that $p$ must be a prime factor of $x$, meaning that we can say that $x \ = \ ap$ for some integer $a$. It follows that 
        a can range from $1$ to $\ell = \left \lfloor{\frac{D}{p}} \right \rfloor$, as we have:
        <br><br>
        $$\frac{D}{p} \ \leq \ \ell \ + \ 1 \ = \ \left \lfloor{\frac{D}{p}} \right \rfloor \ + \ 1$$
        <br>
        And since $\ell + 1$ is the next integer above $\ell$, any integer $y$ greater than $\ell$ will result in $yp \geq D$. Thus, there are $\ell$ 
        different values of $a$. This means that the number of integers that <b>are</b> coprime with $p^{\alpha}$ is given by $D \ - \ \ell \ - \ 1$, where 
        we have subtracted $1$ from the difference of $D$ and $\ell$ to ensure that $1$ isn't "counted".
       </div>
       
       <br><br>
       An important property to note about this matrix is that it is non-negative and symmetric. This means that each entry is greater than our equal to $0$, and 
       the matrix is invariant under taking the transpose.
