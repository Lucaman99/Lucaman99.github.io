<h2>Coprime States - Notes</h2>
<p>
    <h4>Defining Coprime States</h4>
   We define a coprime state as a two-qudit state $|\psi_k\rangle$, such that:
  <br><br> 
   $$|\psi_k\rangle \ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \displaystyle\sum_{n \ = \ k}^{D} \displaystyle\sum_{m \ = \ k}^{D} G(n, m) |n \ m\rangle$$ 
   <br>
   Where we define $G(m, n) \ = \ 1$ if $\gcd(m, n) = 1$ and $0$ otherwise. In addition, we let $k \in \{1, 2\}$, since we will concern oursevles with coprime states
   where we consider $1$ and any other positive integer to be coprime, and states where we don't consider this to be the case. We can go on to consider the density
   matrix defined by the coprime state, which will be given as $\rho_k$:
   <br><br>
    $$\rho_k \ = \ |\psi_k\rangle \langle \psi_k | \ = \ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{a, b} \displaystyle\sum_{c, d} |a \ b\rangle \langle c \ d|$$
   <br>
   Where $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $\gcd(c, d) = 1$. From the density matrix, we can determine more proerties about this quantum state. First, let us consider what happens
   when we take the partial trace over the second subsystem of our state (as we will eventually need this to calculate the entropy of entanglement). We have:
   <br><br>
    $$\rho^{A}_{k} \ = \ \displaystyle\sum_{i} \langle i_B | \rho_k |i_B \rangle \ = \ 
    \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{i} \displaystyle\sum_{a, b} \displaystyle\sum_{c, d} \big[\langle i | b \rangle \langle c | i \rangle \big] |a\rangle \langle d |
     \ = \ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{a, b} \displaystyle\sum_{c, d} \delta_{bc} |a\rangle \langle d |$$
   <br>
   Where $\delta_{bc}$ is the Kronecker delta for $b$ and $c$. Thus, we are effectively summing over the outer product of all basis states that <b>share at least one 
       common positive integer that is coprime to both $a$ and $b$</b>, with different coefficients on each term.
       <br><br>
       We can reduce this further by noting that the coefficient on each term of the sum will simply be the number of positive integers between $k$ and $D$ such that 
       the integer is both coprime with $a$ and $d$ We will call this coefficient $\sigma(a, d)$, and we can write the density matrix as:
        <br><br>
        $$\rho^{A}_{k} \ = \ \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle\sum_{a, d} \sigma(a, d) |a\rangle \langle d|$$ 
       <br>
       This seems to be somewhat related to the definition of the Euler totient function, $\phi(n)$, which is defined to 
       be the number of integers below $n$ that are also coprime to $n$. For instance, in the case of $a = d = D$, we have $\sigma(a, d) = \phi(D)$. We can also look at special 
       cases, for different values of $a$ and $b$. For instance, if both $a$ and $b$ are prime, then they will be coprime with every positive integer between $D$ and $k$, except 
       the number itself, thus we will have $\sigma(a, b) \ = \ D - k$. 
       <br><br>
       An important property to note about this matrix is that it is non-negative and symmetric. This means that each entry is greater than our equal to $0$, and 
       the matrix is invariant under taking the transpose.
