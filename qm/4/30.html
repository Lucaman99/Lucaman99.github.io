<h2>Griffiths Quantum Mechanics 2nd Edition: Problems 4.30</h2>
<p>
So we are asked to find the general spin matrix (matrix representation of the spin operator) that represents the componenet of spin in the direction of some arbitrary unit vector $\hat{r}$.
We are given $\hat{r}$ as a sum of componenets of the basis of the 3-dimensional space:
<br><br>
$$\hat{r} \ = \ \sin \theta \cos \phi \ \hat{i} \ + \ \sin \theta \sin \phi \ \hat{j} \ + \ \cos \theta \ \hat{k}$$
<br>
We are also told that in addition to finding the spin matrix $\textbf{S}_{r}$, we also have to find the normalized eigenspinors and eigenvalues of the spin matrix. To begin, we have to think about
what $\textbf{S}_r$ actually represents. We want to find the spin along some arbitrary direction. For the angular momentum in direction $\hat{r}$, we know that a measurement of angular momentum will
be a sum of the angular momentum in the $x, \ y, \ z$ componenets that make up $\hat{r}$ (as you recall, we previously defined total angular momentum as the sum of all the components of angular momentum. In this case,
the only thing that changes is we are only interested in the amount of each of the components that are pointing along $\hat{r}$).
<br>
In the same form as the previous relationship, we have:
<br><br>
$$S_{r} \ \hat{r} \ = \ \sin \theta \cos \phi \ S_{x} \hat{i} \ + \ \sin \theta \sin \phi \ S_{y} \hat{j} \ + \ \cos \theta \ S_{z} \hat{k}$$
<br>
This is because we are multiplying each unit vector in their respective directions by the total amount of angular momentum measured in that direction, then multiplying by the fraction representing "amount of angular momentum that is measured along $\hat{r}$" in that particular direction.
