<h2>Griffiths Quantum Mechanics 2nd Edition: Problems 4.39 (And The Tale of the Added Negative Sign)</h2>
<p>
Now, before I launch into this solution, I want to add a bit of a disclaimer. I worked for a long time on this solution, many many hours. I mostly solved this problem over the course of two days. On the second day,
I was still struggling and not getting the answer that was expected to arise from this solution method. I finally decided to give up and check the PhysicsPAges website to see where I went wrong. By doing this, and looking at
their proof, I realized I had done literally every single thing correct (we had virtually the exact same method of solving the problem), except I accidentally made my energy negative in the first step of the solution by just thinking "oh a bound
state, energy must be negative", without thinking about what the energy states of the quantum harmonic oscillator sgould be (suprise, they're positive, this was shown way earlier in the textbook and is something that I should have remembered/not been stupid enough
to gloss over). Now, I try to stay super ethical with my solution-writing efforts. All of my work is my own, but occasionally, I'll make a stupid mistake like this (pointed out to me by a another source). I'm still writing this solution because I worked super hard on this
problem, and I was so excited to share my methods of coming to my final answer, so I don't want that to be ruined by the accidental inclusion of a negative sign.

Without further confession, let's jump into the soluiton!
