<h2>Griffiths Quantum Mechanics 2nd Edition: Problem 6.39</h2>
<p>
   This is the first post to my webstie using LaTeX.css. I'm probably going to use it for all of my posts now (it looks so much cleaner than my previous format, 
   and has built-in functionality that supports writing lemmas, theorems, proofs, etc.)

   We are asked to consider a model of perturbations in a crystal lattice. We begin with the Hamiltonian that describes a hydrogen atom, and then 
   we perturb it in the following way: we place three pairs of point charges at equal radius around the hydrogen atom (which are supposed to model the protons 
   in neighbouring atoms, in a hexagonal lattice of hydrogen atoms). In order to do this, we must understand how these pertrubations will interact with the electron, 
   and how they will interact with the proton. Let's start by considering proton-proton interactions. We let the distance from the central proton to the $i$-th
   neighbouring proton to be $d_i$, and the charge to be $q_i$.
